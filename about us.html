					<p align="justify">Measures like extensive computerization, decentralization of collection of passport applications through PACCs/DPCs/SPCs, opening of new passport offices and reforms in the Central Passport Organization having fallen short of meeting the fast growing passport   demand  and heightened expectations of the public, a need was felt for complete overhaul of passport issuance system. To address this need, a Mission Mode Project named Passport Seva Project (PSP) was identified under the National e-Governance Plan.<b> The PSP aims "to deliver all Passport-related services to the citizens in a timely, transparent, more accessible, reliable manner & in a comfortable environment through streamlined processes and committed, trained & motivated workforce". </b></p>
					<p align="justify">The PSP has been launched in Public-Private-Partnership (PPP)   mode with   M/s. Tata Consultancy Services as Service Provider.  The sovereign and fiduciary functions like verification, granting, issuing/revocation/impounding of passports have been retained by MEA. The ownership and strategic control of the core assets including data/information is with the Ministry.</p>
